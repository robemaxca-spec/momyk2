All website content is in one file: `data/siteData.json`

The dev server auto-reloads on file save.  
Edit → Save → See change in browser!

### Tip 3: Test on Mobile
Open on your phone: `http://YOUR-IP-ADDRESS:3000`  
(Find your IP with `ipconfig` or `ifconfig`)

### Tip 4: Before Deploying
Run production build test:

npm run build
npm start
```
